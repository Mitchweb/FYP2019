Repo for Mitchell Clarkson's Final Year Project for 3rd Year BSc Computer Science
## Description
Proof-of-concept for a website, StudentBee, that matched entrepreneurial students with an appropriate business support network in their local area, by asking students to take part in an interactive quiz. StudentBee was developed as part of the dissertation for my BSc Computer Science degree.

I took advantage of the WordPress CMS, and built a bespoke theme and plugin that:
* used jQuery and CSS transitions to provide an interactive, SPA quiz for students to complete,
* used JavaScript and PHP to support user accounts, provide administration screens for enterprise organisations, and access a MySQL database,
* used Python to build a recommender system that matched students with enterprise organisations, based on their answers to the quiz.
## Technology
### Frontend
HTML, SCSS, JavaScript (with jQuery)
### Backend
PHP, MySQL, Python
